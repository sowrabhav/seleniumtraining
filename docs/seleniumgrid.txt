To set up Selenium Grid, follow these steps:

1. **Download Selenium Server**:
   Download the Selenium Server jar file from the official Selenium website.

2. **Start the Hub**:
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the Selenium Server jar file is located. Run the following command to start the hub:

   ```sh
   java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar hub
   ```

   This will start the Selenium Grid hub on `http://localhost:4444`.

3. **Start the Nodes**:
   Open another terminal and navigate to the directory where the Selenium Server jar file is located. Run the following command to start a node:

   ```sh
   java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register
   ```

   You can start multiple nodes on different machines by specifying the hub URL.

4. **Configure the Nodes (Optional)**:
   You can create a JSON configuration file to customize the node settings. Here is an example `nodeConfig.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "capabilities": [
       {
         "browserName": "chrome",
         "maxInstances": 5
       },
       {
         "browserName": "firefox",
         "maxInstances": 5
       }
     ],
     "configuration": {
       "hub": "http://localhost:4444/grid/register",
       "maxSession": 5
     }
   }
   ```

   Start the node with the configuration file:

   ```sh
   java -jar selenium-server-<version>.jar node --config nodeConfig.json
   ```

5. **Verify the Setup**:
   Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4444/grid/console` to see the status of the hub and connected nodes.

This setup will allow you to run your Selenium tests on a distributed grid of machines.
